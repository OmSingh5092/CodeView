## What is Code View?

CodeView is a web app for taking online coding interviews. It provides a good and easy solution for software interviews which requires interviewee to write code for the problems put on by the interviewer.
Interviewer could make a room which the candidate can join during the interview to write the code. No screen sharing is required, every change and update in the code is live for both.
This makes the online interview process easy to be managed by the interviewer.
